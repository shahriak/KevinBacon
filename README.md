# KevinBacon

## Overview
Designed and implmented a game called "The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon". The game is based upon the theory that every actor can be connected to actor Kevin Bacon by a chain of movies no more than 6 in length. Most, but not all, can reach him in 6 steps. 12% of all actors cannot reach him at all.

Wrote the HTML/CSS and PHP code for a web site called MyMDb that mimics part of the popular IMDb movie database site. The site shows the movies in which another actor has appeared
with Kevin Bacon. The site also shows a list of all movies in which the other actor has appeared.

### Technologies:
HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL
